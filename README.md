It is a platform where cricket teams and franchises can buy players. The marketplace operates via blockchain technology and facilitates the bidding and trading process for cricket players.The auctionhouse marketplace works by inviting cricket players to register their profiles on the platform, complete with their cricketing statistics and other relevant information. This information is used to create mintable NFT's associated with each cricket player who chose to register himself on our platform. Cricket teams and franchises can then browse the available players and place bids on the ones they are interested in acquiring.

The auction process usually takes place in a live auction event, where team owners and representatives bid against each other in real-time for the players they want. The bidding process is facilitated by the rules mentioned as per the contract. Once a bid is accepted, the player is sold to the highest bidder, and the team or franchise takes ownership of the player's NFT. Once a player is sold other bidders can withdraw their funds.

A live player rating is given at the end of the tournament to each player. Ratings of all players in a team are added and the team with the most point is declared winner of the tournament.
