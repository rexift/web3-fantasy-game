* The rise of fantasy sports in India has been phenomenal in recent years, with millions of players participating in various fantasy sports platforms. The Indian fantasy sports market is projected to continue its upward trajectory, with more players and platforms entering the market and innovative features being introduced to attract new users. But this brings in numerous problems that exists in the current system:

    * Data privacy: Fantasy sports platforms collect a lot of data about their users, which raises concerns over data privacy. There have been instances of data breaches in the past, which have led to the leakage of sensitive information.

    * Insider trading: Insider trading is a major concern in fantasy sports, where employees of fantasy sports operators have access to inside information that could give them an unfair advantage in the games. This could lead to a situation where some players have an unfair advantage over others.

    * Lack of transparency: There have been instances where fantasy sports operators have been accused of not disclosing enough information about their games, such as the rules and scoring systems. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for players to make informed decisions.

<br>

* We are trying to improve the current system of fantasy sports by using oracles that will securely send data to smart contracts which would prohibit any possibility of data manipulation. These steps ensure that our system is an upgrade to any existing fantasy sports game!!

    * All the data will be saved securely on the blockchain network thus it cannot be manipulated or tampered with making our game transparent to the users. This will develop a sense of trust between our users and our game.

    * Each team will have equal amount of tokens to spend after registering which would make sure that no one gains any kind of unfair advantage.

    * Teams will be able to select their players based on an auction which is a game of skill and exempt it from gambling laws. It also makes the game more competitive than the existing fantasy games.

    * The players that we are auctioning are actually NFT's which means they cannot be changed after the auction has ended and any team that has purchased it will have access to it until the end of the auction.

    * All the auctions are automated using chainlink automation thus not even the owner of this project can stop the auctions once it has started.

<br>

* Currently, the project supports the following features but more features are in progress and will be integrated in the near future.

    * A live auction where teams can can bid for a player. The team with the highest bidding amount will win the player for the current game.

    * The winner for the current game will be decided based on the cumulative ranking of each player purchased by the team. The ranking of each player are taken from an external api using oracles.

    * Each auction is automated using chainlink automation meaning they cannot be changed even by the owner of the project.

<br>

* More features that we are planning to integrate in the future: 

    * Ability to have multiple games running in parallel so that teams can select which game to participate in.

    * Each game will have auction rules that the owner can set. Teams will have to follow these rules during the auction and form a team accordinly to be eligible for the prize money.

    * Certain amount of in-game tokens will be sent to the team wallet once they register and all the transactions will take place using this token only.

<br>

* The current target audience mostly include college students and working professionals who are sports enthusiasts who enjoy following their favorite sports teams and players. Due to its transparency, casual gamers will be able to trust it and spend without worrying about getting scammed giving it wider reach.
